# Introduction

Revive is a general platform that aims to bring automatic decision-making to real-world scenario.
The platform operates in a pipeline of two steps:
1. **Venv Training:** A virtual-environment model is trained from any offline data to mimic each agent's policy along with the transition between states (also known as nature policy).
2. **Policy Training:** Treat one of the agents as the active agent and freeze others as its environment. Train the active agent with reinforcement learning to derive a better policy for the agent.


# Documentation

The tutorials and API documentation are hosted on https://revive.cn/help/polixir-revive-sdk/index.html.


# Installation

### Requirements

-   Linux x86\_64
-   [Python](https://python.org/): v3.6.0+ / v3.7.0+ / v3.8.0+
-   [CUDA Toolkit](https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-toolkit) (If NVIDIA
    CUDA GPU device is available.)

###  Install REVIVE

You can install the latest sversion of the from a cloned Git repository:

    $ git clone https://agit.ai/Polixir/revive
    $ cd revive
    $ pip install -e .

You can also view and download all versions of the code package through the releases page.

**Releases Page :** https://agit.ai/Polixir/revive/releases

###  Apply for License

The revive library was developed by polixir, we have encrypted and protected a small number of algorithm modules in 
revive that have their own intellectual property rights, you can apply for a license to use the complete algorithm 
package functionality.

**Application Page :** <https://www.revive.cn>

###  Use the License

After applying for a license, you will get a file with the file name `license.lic`.
Upload your license file to the machine where revive is installed, and set the
environment variable `PYARMOR_LICENSE`.

1.  Open the `.bashrc` file in your home directory (for example,`/home/your-user-name/.bashrc`) in a text editor.
2.  Add `export PYARMOR_LICENSE="/license_save_dir/license.lic"` to thelast line of the file, where `/license_save_dir/license.lic` is is
    the path to the file where the license is stored.
3.  Save the `.bashrc` file.
4.  Use the command `source /home/your-user-name/.bashrc` to reload `.bashrc` settings.


# Usage

###  Prepare Data
Data should all be put in the `data` folder. See instruction to build your data in https://revive.cn/help/polixir-revive-sdk/index.html.

###  Train Model
`python train.py`. By default, the script will start local ray service and launch venv training and policy training both in tuning mode. You can change that behavior in command line, run `python train.py -h` for more information. For general configurations, please see `data/config.json`. For algorithm specific configurations, please see its own file. You can also modify the json file. Pass the path of the json file to the training scripts, e.g. `python train.py ... -rcf config.json` will overwrite the configurable parameters.

To run training across multiple nodes, you need to manually setup the ray cluster. Start cluster on the head node with `ray start --head --port 6379` in command line or join an existing cluster by `ray start --address=xxx --redis-password=xxx`. Pass `--address auto` when training.

```

To add a new algorithm, you only needs to inherit the base class and implement `model_creator`, `optimizer_creator`, `train_batch` and `validate_batch`, then the code is ready to run. You can use the existing implementation as references.
